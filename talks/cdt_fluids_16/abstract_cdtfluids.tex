\title{Fitted Finite Element Discretization of Two-Phase Navier-Stokes Flow}

\maketitle
We propose a novel fitted finite element method for two-phase Navier-Stokes flow
problems that uses piecewise linear finite elements to approximate the moving
interface. The meshes describing the discrete interface in general do not
deteriorate in time, which means that in numerical simulations a smoothing or a
remeshing of the interface mesh is not necessary. We present several numerical
experiments for our numerical method, which demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of the proposed algorithm.
