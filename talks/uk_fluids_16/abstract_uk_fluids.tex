\title{Fitted ALE scheme for Two-Phase Navier--Stokes Flow}

\maketitle

We present a novel fitted ALE scheme for two-phase Navier--Stokes flow problems
that uses piecewise linear finite elements to approximate the moving interface.
The meshes describing the discrete interface in general do not deteriorate in
time, which means that in numerical simulations a smoothing or a remeshing of
the interface mesh is not necessary.
