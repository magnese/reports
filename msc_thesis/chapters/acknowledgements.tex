\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to all those who gave me the possibility to complete this thesis.

I am grateful to Los Alamos National Laboratory for the great opportunity which has been offered to me and the Department of Energy of United States of America who supported this work. In particular, I would like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Dr G. Delzanno, Dr Z. Guo and Dr X. Tang from LANL whose help, suggestions and encouragement helped me to accomplish this work.

I also want to thank my advisors Prof. N. Bellomo, Prof. G. Coppa and Prof. L. Formaggia for all their support.

I want to express a great gratitude to my mother, my father and Alessandro which have always supported me and believed in me.

A special thanks to my ``second brother'', Ivan, and Federica for their friendship.

I want to thank Francesco and Marco who helped me to survive 11 months in the middle of nowhere, without them Los Alamos would have been very boring, and Lorenzo for the five years spent together at the Politecnico.

Finally, I want to thank Silvia who has been very patient for almost one year; she helped me to prove that the ``Los Alamos curse'' can be defeated.
