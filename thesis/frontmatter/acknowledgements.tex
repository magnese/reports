My greatest thanks are for my supervisor, Robert, for his continuous help and
support, and for the precious discussions which enriched my knowledge and
passion for research. Without him none of this would have been possible.

I would also like to thank Imperial College for giving me this incredible
opportunity and the Math department for being a second home during these past
four years. A special thank you goes to the DUNE community and in particular the
DUNE-FEM team from which I learned a lot. I would like to thank Andrea for all
the help he gave me. A huge thank you is for my office mates in 757 with whom I
spent many happy hours. Thank you guys for the board games lessons.

I want to thank all my London friends who were patient enough to put up with
me during this long journey. As usual, my family has been the greatest source
of support and love and I can never thank them enough for everything they do
for me.

A final thank you to Silvia, who, without any hesitation, moved to London with
me. Her continuous love and trust have been indispensable to go trough this
adventure.
