Fluid flow problems with a moving interface are found in many applications in
physics and engineering. In these type of problems, apart from the unknown flow
in the bulk domain, also the position of the free surface needs to be
determined.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate front tracking finite element methods
applied to two-phase incompressible Navier--Stokes flows. The front tracking
approach consists on seeking a parametrization of the unknown interface over a
reference manifold. A novel variational formulation for the interface evolution
is used. This formulation preserves, in general, the interface mesh quality
over time. Moreover, being a fitted approach, the interface mesh is made up of
faces of elements belonging to the bulk mesh.

Several fully discrete finite element approximations are derived and, wherever
possible, stability and existence results are proved. In order to demonstrate
the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithms, extensive numerical
experiments are carried out, both in 2d and in 3d. A variety of finite element
spaces are used. Smoothing and remeshing routines are applied to the bulk mesh
to avoid heavily distorted simplicies.
