\section[Free-boundary fluid flows]{Free-boundary fluid flows}
Fluid flow problems with a moving interface are encountered in many
applications in physics, engineering and biophysics. Typical applications are
drops and bubbles, die swell, dam break, liquid storage tanks, dendritic growth,
ink-jet printing, fuel injection. For this reason, developing robust and
efficient numerical methods for these flows is an important problem and
has attracted tremendous interest over the last decade.

In these type of problems, apart from the flow solution in the bulk domain, the
position of a portion of the boundary is also unknown. This boundary can either
be an external boundary or an interface between sub-domains. At the
boundary/interface, certain boundary conditions need to be fulfilled, which
specify the position of the boundary. These conditions relate the variables of
the flow, velocity and pressure, across the domains under consideration of
external influences, such as for example surface tension. Numerically, in order
to be able to compute the flow solution as well as the boundary/interface
geometry, a measure to track the boundary starting from an initial position
needs to be incorporated.

The scenario we consider are two-phase flows, liquid-liquid or liquid-gas, in a
$d$-dimensional computational domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. This domain
$\Omega$ contains two different immiscible fluids which, for all $t\in[0,T]$,
occupy time dependent regions $\Omega_+(t)$ and
$\Omega_-(t):=\Omega\setminus\overline{\Omega}_+(t)$ and
which are separated by an interface $(\Gamma(t))_{t\in[0,T]}$,
$\Gamma(t)\subset\Omega$. See Figure~\ref{fig:two_phase} for an illustration.

Therefore both the sub-domains themselves and the flow field are part of the
solution. Indeed the main task in this context is to account for the interface
$\Gamma(t)$, which separates the distinct fluid domains and is generally in
motion. Apart from its exact position, the computation of geometrical quantities
of $\Gamma(t)$ such as its normal vector $\nu$ and its curvature $\varkappa$ are
of interest.

\section[Flow governing equations]{Flow governing equations}
For what concern the bulk flow, we restrict ourselves to isothermal conditions,
incompressible fluids and we assume that there is no change of phase. Under
this assumption, the fluid dynamics is modeled by the incompressible
Navier--Stokes equations.

Denoting the velocity and pressure by $\vec u$ and $p$, respectively, we
introduce the Newtonian stress tensor
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stress_tensor}
\mat\sigma = \mu \,(\nabla\,\vec u + (\nabla\,\vec u)^T) - p\,\mat\id
= 2\,\mu\, \mat D(\vec u)-p\,\mat\id\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mu(t) = \mu_+\,\charfcn{\Omega_+(t)} + \mu_-\,\charfcn{\Omega_-(t)}$,
with $\mu_\pm \in \R_{>0}$, denotes the dynamic viscosities in the two phases,
$\mat\id \in \R^{d \times d}$ is the identity matrix and
$\mat D(\vec u):=\frac{1}{2}\, (\nabla\vec u+(\nabla\vec u)^T)$
is the rate-of-deformation tensor. Moreover, let
$\rho(t) = \rho_+\,\charfcn{\Omega_+(t)} + \rho_-\,\charfcn{\Omega_-(t)}$,
with $\rho_\pm \in \R_{>0}$, be the fluid density.

Imposing the conservation of momentum and mass in each phase, the following
standard Navier--Stokes governing equations can be derived:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\rho\,(\vec u_t +\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u)- \nabla\,.\,\mat\sigma
& = \vec f \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_momentum} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_mass}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where $\vec f$ includes all external body forces referred to the unit mass of
fluid.

Substituting (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}) in (\ref{eq:ns_momentum}), we obtain the
well known incompressible Navier--Stokes model:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\rho\,(\vec u_t +\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u) -2 \mu\,\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)+
\nabla\,p & = \vec f \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_momentum_bis} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,.
\label{eq:ns_mass_bis}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

To better grasp the physical meaning of the terms appearing in the momentum
equation (\ref{eq:ns_momentum_bis}) we briefly describe them. The inertia term
$\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u$ is a convection term arising from the conservation
of momentum. The momentum of each portion of fluid needs to be conserved
therefore it needs to move with the fluid which means that it is convected with
the fluid. The pressure term $\nabla\,p$  is originated by the Newtonian
constitutive equation (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}) and it represent all the forces
resulting from pressure differences within the fluid. Finally, the friction
term $\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)$, which again arises from the Newtonian
constitutive equation (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}), is a diffusion operator
equalizing the velocity of neighbouring elements. The more viscous the fluid,
the stronger is the friction between neighbouring particles and thus the
equalizing effect.

The Reynolds number $\Rey$ is an important dimensionless quantity in fluid
mechanics and it is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reynolds}
\Rey=\frac{\rho\,u_c\,L_c}{\mu}\,,
\end{equation}
where $L_c$ is the characteristic dimension of the problem and $u_c$ is the
characteristic velocity of the fluid. It quantifies the ratio of inertial
forces to viscous forces within the fluid therefor it is used to predict
flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. If $\Rey \ll 1$ the flow is
laminar due to the fact that viscous forces are dominant and it is
characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion.  Otherwise, the flow is
turbulent due to the fact that inertial forces are dominant and it tend to
produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other flow instabilities.

In the case of laminar flow, the advective term in the momentum equation
(\ref{eq:ns_momentum}) can be neglected, giving rise to the so called Stokes
equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
- \nabla\,.\,\mat\sigma & = \vec f \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:momentum} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:mass}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
which for Newtonian fluids are expressed as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
-2 \mu\,\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)+ \nabla\,p & = \vec f \quad &&\mbox{in }
\Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:momentum_bis} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,.
\label{eq:mass_bis}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
