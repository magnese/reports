\section[Free-boundary fluid flows]{Free-boundary fluid flows}
Fluid flow problems with a moving interface are encountered in many
applications in physics, engineering and biophysics. Typical applications are
drops and bubbles, die swell, dam break, liquid storage tanks, dendritic growth,
ink-jet printing, fuel injection. For this reason, developing robust and
efficient numerical methods for these flows is an important problem and
has attracted tremendous interest over the last decade.

In these type of problems, apart from the flow solution in the bulk domain, the
position of a portion of the boundary is also unknown. This boundary can either
be an external boundary or an interface between sub-domains. At the
boundary/interface, certain boundary conditions need to be fulfilled, which
specify the position of the boundary. These conditions relate the variables of
the flow, velocity and pressure, across the domains under consideration of
external influences, such as for example surface tension. Numerically, in order
to be able to compute the flow solution as well as the boundary/interface
geometry, a measure to track the boundary starting from an initial position
needs to be incorporated.

The scenario we consider are two-phase flows, liquid-liquid or liquid-gas, in a
$d$-dimensional computational domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. This domain
$\Omega$ contains two different immiscible fluids which, for all $t\in[0,T]$,
occupy time dependent regions $\Omega_+(t)$ and
$\Omega_-(t):=\Omega\setminus\overline{\Omega}_+(t)$ and
which are separated by an interface $(\Gamma(t))_{t\in[0,T]}$,
$\Gamma(t)\subset\Omega$. For later use, we always assume that
$(\Gamma(t))_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a sufficiently smooth evolving hypersurface
without boundary. See Figure~\ref{fig:two_phase} for an illustration.

Therefore both the sub-domains themselves and the flow field are part of the
solution. Indeed the main task in this context is to account for the interface
$\Gamma(t)$, which separates the distinct fluid domains and is generally in
motion. Apart from its exact position, the computation of geometrical quantities
of $\Gamma(t)$ such as its normal vector $\nu$ and its mean curvature
$\varkappa$ are of interest.

\section[Flow governing equations]{Flow governing equations}
For what concern the bulk flow, we restrict ourselves to isothermal conditions,
incompressible fluids and we assume that there is no change of phase. Under
this assumption, the fluid dynamics is modeled by the incompressible
Navier--Stokes equations.

Denoting the velocity and pressure by $\vec u$ and $p$, respectively, we
introduce the Newtonian stress tensor
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stress_tensor}
\mat\sigma = \mu \,(\nabla\,\vec u + (\nabla\,\vec u)^T) - p\,\mat\id
= 2\,\mu\, \mat D(\vec u)-p\,\mat\id\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mu(t) = \mu_+\,\charfcn{\Omega_+(t)} + \mu_-\,\charfcn{\Omega_-(t)}$,
with $\mu_\pm \in \R_{>0}$, denotes the dynamic viscosities in the two phases,
$\mat\id \in \R^{d \times d}$ is the identity matrix and
$\mat D(\vec u):=\frac{1}{2}\, (\nabla\vec u+(\nabla\vec u)^T)$
is the rate-of-deformation tensor. Moreover, let
$\rho(t) = \rho_+\,\charfcn{\Omega_+(t)} + \rho_-\,\charfcn{\Omega_-(t)}$,
with $\rho_\pm \in \R_{>0}$, be the fluid density.

Imposing the conservation of momentum and mass in each phase, the following
standard Navier--Stokes governing equations can be derived:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\rho\,(\vec u_t +\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u)- \nabla\,.\,\mat\sigma
& = \vec f \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_momentum} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_mass}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where $\vec f$ includes all external body forces referred to the unit mass of
fluid.

Substituting (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}) in (\ref{eq:ns_momentum}), we obtain the
well known incompressible Navier--Stokes model:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\rho\,(\vec u_t +\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u) -2 \mu\,\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)+
\nabla\,p & = \vec f \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:ns_momentum_bis} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,.
\label{eq:ns_mass_bis}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

To better grasp the physical meaning of the terms appearing in the momentum
equation (\ref{eq:ns_momentum_bis}) we briefly describe them. The inertia term
$\vec u \,.\, \nabla \vec u$ is a convection term arising from the conservation
of momentum. The momentum of each portion of fluid needs to be conserved
therefore it needs to move with the fluid which means that it is convected with
the fluid. The pressure term $\nabla\,p$  is originated by the Newtonian
constitutive equation (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}) and it represent all the forces
resulting from pressure differences within the fluid. Finally, the friction
term $\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)$, which again arises from the Newtonian
constitutive equation (\ref{eq:stress_tensor}), is a diffusion operator
equalizing the velocity of neighbouring elements. The more viscous the fluid,
the stronger is the friction between neighbouring particles and thus the
equalizing effect.

The Reynolds number $\Rey$ is an important dimensionless quantity in fluid
mechanics and it is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reynolds}
\Rey=\frac{\rho\,u_c\,L_c}{\mu}\,,
\end{equation}
where $L_c$ is the characteristic dimension of the problem and $u_c$ is the
characteristic velocity of the fluid. It quantifies the ratio of inertial
forces to viscous forces within the fluid therefor it is used to predict
flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. If $\Rey \ll 1$ the flow is
laminar due to the fact that viscous forces are dominant and it is
characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion.  Otherwise, the flow is
turbulent due to the fact that inertial forces are dominant and it tend to
produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other flow instabilities.

In the case of laminar flow, the advective term in the momentum equation
(\ref{eq:ns_momentum}) can be neglected, giving rise to the so called Stokes
equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
- \nabla\,.\,\mat\sigma & = \vec f \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:momentum} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \qquad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:mass}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
which for Newtonian fluids are expressed as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
-2 \mu\,\nabla\,.\,\mat D(\vec u)+ \nabla\,p & = \vec f \quad &&\mbox{in }
\Omega_\pm(t)\,,
\label{eq:momentum_bis} \\
\nabla\,.\,\vec u & = 0 \quad &&\mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,.
\label{eq:mass_bis}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

\section[Boundary, initial, and interface conditions]{Boundary, initial, and
interface conditions}
For the full Navier--Stokes problem (\ref{eq:ns_momentum_bis}-b), a
divergence-free velocity field for the whole computational domain is needed as
an initial condition therefore we impose
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ns_ic}
\vec u(0) = \vec u_0 \qquad \mbox{in } \Omega_\pm(t)\,.
\end{equation}
The initial condition is not need in the Stokes case (\ref{eq:momentum_bis}-b)
since it is a stationary problem.

In order to obtain a well-posed system, boundary conditions have to be imposed
on the bulk domain boundary $\partial\Omega$. Usually, we use the homogeneous
Dirichlet condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ns_bc}
\vec u = \vec 0 \qquad \mbox{on } \partial \Omega\,,
\end{equation}
and/or a free-slip condition.

Since we are dealing with a two-phase flow, some interface conditions are also
needed on the unknown interface $\Gamma(t)$ which couple the velocity and
stress between the two domains. Viscosity of the fluids leads to the continuity
condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_jump_velocity}
[\vec u]_-^+ = \vec 0 \qquad \mbox{on } \Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
where $[\vec u]_-^+ := \vec u_+ - \vec u_-$ denote the jump in velocity across
the interface $\Gamma(t)$. Here and throughout, we employ the shorthand notation
$\vec g_\pm := \vec g\!\mid_{\Omega_\pm(t)}$ for a function
$\vec g : \Omega \times [0,T] \to \R^d$; and similarly for scalar and
matrix-valued functions.

The assumption that there is no change of phase leads to the dynamic interface
condition
\begin{equation} \label{eq:interface_velocity}
\vec{\mathcal{V}}\,.\,\vec\nu = \vec u\,.\,\vec \nu \qquad \mbox{on }
\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
given that $\vec{\mathcal{V}}$ is the velocity of the evolving interface
$\Gamma(t)$ and where $\vec\nu(t)$ is the unit normal on $\Gamma(t)$ pointing
into $\Omega_+(t)$. Therefore the normal velocity of the interface needs to
match the flow normal velocity across the interface $\Gamma(t)$.

The momentum conservation in a small material volume that intersects the
interface leads to the stress balance condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_jump_stress_div}
[\mat\sigma\,\vec \nu]_-^+ = \nabs\,.\mat\sigma_{\Gamma} \qquad \mbox{on }
\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mat\sigma_{\Gamma}$ is the interface stress tensor and $\nabs\,.$ is
the surface divergence on $\Gamma(t)$. The operator $\nabs$ is the surface
gradient on $\Gamma(t)$ and it is the projection of the usual gradient operator
$\nabla$ on the surface $\Gamma(t)$. Therefore, given a smooth function $g$
defined on a neighbourhood of $\Gamma(t)$, it is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_gradient}
\nabs\,g(\vec z)=\mat P\,\nabla\,g(\vec z)=\nabla\,g(\vec z)\,-
\,\nabla\,g(\vec z)\,.\,\vec\nu(\vec z)\,\vec\nu(\vec z)\,,\qquad \vec z
\in\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
with the usual projection operator $\mat P$ defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_projection}
\mat P(\vec z)=\mat\id\,-\,\vec\nu(\vec z)\,\vec\nu(\vec z)^T\,,\qquad \vec
z\in \Gamma(t)\,.
\end{equation}
For later use, we also define the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta_s$ on
$\Gamma(t)$ as $\Delta_s = \nabs\,.\,\nabs$.

We restrict ourselves to the case that the only force acting on the interface
is the surface tension contact force therefore the interface stress tensor
$\mat\sigma_\Gamma$ has the following constitutive equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_stress_tensor}
\mat\sigma_{\Gamma}=\gamma\,\mat P\,,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the surface tension coefficient. Substituting
(\ref{eq:interface_stress_tensor}) in (\ref{eq:interface_jump_stress_div}) we
obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_stress_tensor_divergence}
[\mat\sigma\,\vec \nu]_-^+ = \nabs\,.(\gamma\,\mat P)=\gamma\,\nabs\mat
P+\nabs\,\gamma=-\gamma\,\varkappa\,\vec\nu + \nabs\,\gamma \qquad \mbox{on }
\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\varkappa = \nabla\,.\vec\nu$ is the mean curvature of $\Gamma(t)$. We
assume that $\gamma$ is constant and therefore, from
(\ref{eq:interface_stress_tensor_divergence}), we obtain the stress balance
condition
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_jump_stress}
[\mat\sigma\,\vec \nu]_-^+ = -\gamma\,\varkappa\,\vec\nu \qquad \mbox{on }
\Gamma(t)\,.
\end{equation}

Finally, in order to have a well-posed problem, one needs suitable initial
conditions for the interface therefore we set $\Gamma(0)=\Gamma_0$.

\section[Interface treatment]{Interface treatment}
The dynamics of the interface is determined by the condition
(\ref{eq:interface_velocity}) which, however, describes the dynamics in a
strongly implicit way since the velocity field $\vec u$ depends on the
position of the interface itself. In numerical simulations there are
several strategies to deal with this problem which can be divided in two
categories depending on the viewpoint: interface capturing and interface
tracking.

Interface capturing methods use an Eulerian description of the interface which
is defined implicitly. A characteristic scalar field $\psi$ is used to identify
the two phases as well as the interface along the boundaries of the individual
fluid domains. Depending on the method, this scalar field may be, for example,
a discontinuous Heaviside function or a signed-distance function. The interface
motion is taken into account using a standard advection equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}+\vec u\,.\nabla\,\psi=0\,,\qquad \mbox{in }
\Omega\,,
\end{equation}
which transport the scalar field with the fluid velocity $\vec u$. The most
important methods which belong to this this category are the particle methods,
the volume-of-fluid method, the level-set method and the phase-field method. In
general, the great advantage of the interface capturing approaches is that they
are inherently able to deal with topological changes of the interface. This
allows a much more flexible interface description than in interface tracking
approaches. On the other hand, it is challenging to treat accurately
discontinuous quantities across the interface, to have mass conservation
within each phase and to apply boundary conditions along the interface.

Interface tracking approaches, instead, use a Lagrangian description of the
interface which is described explicitly. The idea is to take a (virtual)
particle on the interface at $t=t_0$ with Eulerian coordinates $\vec z(0) \in
\Gamma_0$. Let $\vec z(t)$ be the Eulerian coordinates of this particle, with
$t\geq t_0$. The particles on the interface are transported by the flow
velocity $\vec u$, therefore it holds the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \vec z(t)}{\partial t}=\vec u(\vec z(t),t)\,,
\end{equation}
which determines the path of a material particle and consequently it
characterizes the evolution of the interface. This interface representation
forms the basis of the interface tracking methods. In these methods a
collection of markers is put on a given interface $\Gamma_0$ and then
transported (numerically) by the flow velocity $\vec u$ to obtain the markers
on the interface $\Gamma(t)$.
