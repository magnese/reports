\chapter{\sc Geometric Evolution Equations}\label{ch:geometric_pdes}
As starting point, in order to describe the key ideas of the front tracking
approach, we consider the simple problem of purely geometric evolution
equations. The overall goal of this chapter is to give the reader a brief
overview of these time-dependent interface problems, report some useful
definitions and theorems from differential geometry and present an efficient
numerical method to simulate the evolution of closed hypersurfaces in the
setting of the parametric approach. These techniques will be used extensively
in the following chapters in order to simulate the unknown interface in the
two-phase flow context.

The chapter is organised as follows: in \S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes} we
give the definition of geometric evolution equation and in particular we
confine our attention to the so called mean curvature flow and surface
diffusion; in \S\ref{sec:geometric_analysis} we present some definitions
and known results from differential geometry which will be employed throughout
the thesis; in \S\ref{sec:geometric_flows_properties} we report on some
fundamental properties of geometric flows, recalling theoretical results already
proven in the literature; in \S\ref{sec:front_tracking_approach} we
introduce, in order to describe the unknown surface, the front tracking method
which is the technique used in all our schemes; in
\S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes_fem} we discuss the fully practical finite
element approximation for the interface equations which will be used throughout
this thesis and we recall, from the literature, the main results about
existence, uniqueness and stability; in \S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes_semi_fem} we
investigate the equidistribution property and the volume conservation of a
semidiscrete variant of the surface diffusion discretization; in
\S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes_algebraic} we reformulate the discrete schemes
as algebraic systems of equations and we briefly describe the solution technique
adopted; in \S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes_results} we report on three different
experiments in order to show the property of the schemes and of the flows.

\section{Geometric PDEs}\label{sec:geometric_pdes}
A geometric evolution equation defines the motion of a hypersurface
by prescribing its normal velocity in terms of its geometric quantities. These
problems are part of the more general time-dependent interface evolution
problems category, where the normal velocity depends also on field quantities
evaluated on the analysed hypersurface. A detailed description and analysis can
be found in the review article \cite{DeckelnickDE05}.

Interface evolution problems are everywhere in modern physics and engineering.
Several typical applications can be found in materials science, such as the
mathematical modelling of the morphology of microstructure in order to
correctly evaluate the mechanical properties of the material, or in void
electro-stress migration, where small voids or cracks contained in metallic
materials can change their location and shape according to the presence of
surface diffusion and electro-stress loading. Other typical applications, which
can be modelled as time-dependent interface evolution problems, are the motion
of grain boundaries which separate differing orientations of the same
crystalline phase, or solid-liquid interfaces exhibiting dendritic structures in
under-cooled solidification. Another research field where these models can be
applied is image processing to detect the separation of dark regions from a
brighter background and to identify separating contours in order to correctly
cluster the objects in the image. Instead, as explained in Chapter
\ref{ch:introduction}, we apply these techniques to incompressible two-phase
flow problems.

A general geometric evolution equation has the following formulation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:geometric_pde}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu=f(\vec z\,,\vec \nu\,,\varkappa)
\quad\mbox{on }\Gamma(t),
\end{equation}
which prescribes the normal velocity $\V\,.\,\vec\nu$ of the
interface $\Gamma(t)$ as a function depending on the position $\vec z$, its
normal direction $\vec \nu$ and the sum of its principal curvatures
$\varkappa$. The evolution equation (\ref{eq:geometric_pde}) prescribes only
the normal velocity therefore the overall goal is to find a family of
solutions $\{ \Gamma(t) \}_{t \in [0, T]}$ of closed compact and orientable
hypersurfaces in $\R^d$ ($d = 2$ for curves, $d = 3$ for surfaces).

The simplest geometric PDE is the one which arises from motion by mean
curvature,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mean_curvature}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu=\varkappa\quad\mbox{on }\Gamma(t).
\end{equation}
This equation describes a surface evolving in such a way that its own normal
velocity is equal to the sum of the $d-1$ principal curvatures of $\Gamma(t)$.

Another important geometric PDE is the one which arises from motion by
surface diffusion
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_diff}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu=-\Delta_s \varkappa \quad\mbox{on }\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
where we use the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta_s$ defined by
(\ref{eq:surface_laplacian}). In this case the surface normal velocity matches
the surface Laplacian of the mean curvature.

For both models, (\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) and (\ref{eq:surface_diff}), it is
necessary to prescribe the initial interface $\Gamma(0)=\Gamma_0$ in order to
have a well posed problem.

\section{Geometric analysis}\label{sec:geometric_analysis}
The aim of this section is to collect some useful definitions and results from
differential geometry. Again we refer to \cite{DeckelnickDE05}, which covers the
subject in depth.

A subset $\Gamma \subset \R^d$ is called a $C^2$-hypersurface if for each point
$\vec z_0 \in \Gamma$ there exists an open set $G \subset \R^d$ containing
$\vec z_0$ and a function $g \in C^2(G)$ such that
\begin{equation}
G \cap \Gamma = \{ \vec z \in G \, | \, g(\vec z) = 0 \}
\quad \mbox{ and } \quad \nabla \, g(\vec z) \neq 0\,,
\quad \forall\ \vec z \in G \cap \Gamma \, .
\end{equation}
The tangent space $T_{\vec z} \Gamma$ is then the $(d-1)$-dimensional linear
subspace of $\R^d$ that is orthogonal to $\nabla \, g(\vec z)$. It does not
depend on the particular function $g$ which is chosen to describe $\Gamma$. A
$C^2$-hypersurface $\Gamma \in \R^d$ is called orientable if there exists a
vector-valued function $\vec\nu \in C^1(\Gamma, \R^d)$, i.e.~$\vec\nu \in C^1$
in an open neighbourhood of $\Gamma$, such that $\vec\nu(\vec z) \perp T_{\vec
z} \Gamma$ and $|\vec \nu(\vec z)| = 1$ for all $\vec z \in \Gamma$. In what
follows, we shall assume that $\Gamma \subset \R^d$ is an orientable
$C^2$-hypersurface.

In order to prove some property of the surface gradient
(\ref{eq:surface_gradient}), we employ the notation
\begin{equation}
\nabla_s \, g(\vec z) = (\underline{D}_1 g(\vec z), \hdots, \underline{D}_{d}
g(\vec z))
\end{equation}
for the $d$ components of the surface gradient. Since $\nabla_s \, g(\vec z)$
is the orthogonal projection of $\nabla \, g(\vec z)$ onto $T_{\vec z} \Gamma$,
it depends only on the values of $g$ on $\Gamma$, and from
(\ref{eq:surface_gradient}) it follows that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_gradient_comp}
\nabla_s \, g(\vec z) \,.\, \vec \nu(\vec z)=0\,, \quad \vec z \in \Gamma\,.
\end{equation}
Moreover, if $\vec g$ is a differentiable vector field, the surface divergence
can be written as
\begin{equation}
\nabla_s \,.\, \vec g(\vec z) = \sum_{j = 1}^d \underline{D}_j g_j (\vec z)\,,
\quad \vec z \in \Gamma\,,
\end{equation}
while, if $g$ is twice differentiable in an open neighbourhood of
$\Gamma$, the surface Laplacian (\ref{eq:surface_laplacian}) can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_laplacian_comp}
\Delta_s g(\vec z) = \nabla_s\, . \,\nabla_s \, g(\vec z) =
\sum_{i = 1}^d \underline{D}_i \underline{D}_i g(\vec z) \, ,
\quad \vec z \in \Gamma \,.
\end{equation}

We assume $\vec \nu \in C^1$ in a neighbourhood of $\Gamma$ so that we
may introduce the matrix $\mat H(\vec z)$ with components
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrixHjk}
[\mat H (\vec z)]_{jk} = - \underline{D}_j \nu_k (\vec z)\,, \quad \vec z \in
\Gamma \, ,
\end{equation}
with $1\leq j,k\leq n$. It can be shown that $\mat H(\vec z)$ is symmetric.
Furthermore,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k = 1}^d [\mat H(\vec z)]_{jk} \nu_k (\vec z) =
\sum_{k = 1}^d - \underline{D}_j \nu_k (\vec z) \nu_k (\vec z) =
- \tfrac{1}{2} \underline{D}_j |\vec \nu|^2 (\vec z) = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
since $|\vec \nu| = 1$ on $\Gamma$. Thus, $\mat H(\vec z)$ has one
eigenvalue which is equal to zero with corresponding eigenvector
$\vec\nu(\vec z)$. The remaining $d - 1$ eigenvalues $\varkappa_1 (\vec z),
\hdots, \varkappa_{d - 1} (\vec z)$ are called the principal curvatures of
$\Gamma$ at the point $\vec z$. The mean curvature of $\Gamma$ at $\vec z$
can then be defined as the trace of the matrix $\mat H(\vec z)$, that is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:definition_mean_curvature}
\varkappa (\vec z) = \sum_{j = 1}^d [\mat H(\vec z)]_{jj} = \sum_{j = 1}^{d -
1} \varkappa_j (\vec z) \,.
\end{equation}
Note that (\ref{eq:definition_mean_curvature}) differs from the more common
definition of mean curvature $\frac{1}{d - 1} \sum_{j = 1}^{d - 1} \varkappa_j$.
From (\ref{eq:matrixHjk}) we derive the following expression for mean
curvature:
\begin{equation}
\varkappa (\vec z)=-\nabla_s \,.\, \vec \nu(\vec z) \quad \vec z \in \Gamma\,.
\end{equation}
In particular, if $\Gamma$ is the unit sphere,
$\Gamma = \{ \vec z \in \R^d : |\vec z\,| = 1 \}$,
and the unit normal field is chosen to point away from $\Gamma$,
i.e.~$\vec\nu(\vec z) = \vec z$, we obtain that $\varkappa = -
(d - 1)$, on considering the particular function $g(\vec z) = z_j$, with
$1 \leq j \leq d$, and observing that $\underline{D}_i z_j = \delta_{ij} - \nu_j
\nu_i$. This shows that the mean curvature $\varkappa$ is positive if $\Gamma$
is curved in the direction of the normal.

Moreover, while the sign of $\varkappa$ depends on the choice of the normal
$\vec\nu$, the mean curvature vector $\varkappa \vec\nu$ is an invariant. By
choosing again the particular function $g(\vec z) = z_j$, with $1 \leq j \leq
d$, in (\ref{eq:surface_laplacian_comp}) and recalling the application of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator to each independent variable $z_j$, we deduce that
\begin{equation}
\Delta_s z_j = - \sum_{i = 1}^d \underline{D}_i (\nu_j \nu_i) =
- (\nabla_s \,.\, \vec\nu) \nu_j - \nabla_s \, \nu_j \,.\, \vec\nu = \varkappa
\nu_j\, ,
\end{equation}
which leads to the identity
\begin{equation} \label{eq:LBop}
\Delta_s\, \vec \id = \varkappa\, \vec\nu \quad \mbox{on $\Gamma(t)$}\,.
\end{equation}
This identity of differential geometry will be useful at a later stage to
obtain a weak formulation of the surface diffusion and mean curvature problems.

For later use, we also introduce the integration by part formula
\begin{lemma}
Let $\Gamma$ be a hypersurface without boundary. Moreover, let $h$ and $g$
continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of $\Gamma$. Then it holds
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integration_by_part}
\int_\Gamma \nabs\, h\,.\,\nabs\, g \dH{d-1}
=-\int_\Gamma h\,\Delta_s\, g\dH{d-1}\,.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It holds, from \cite[Lemma~16.1]{GilbargT01},
\begin{equation*}
\int_\Gamma \underline{D}_i\,\eta \dH{d-1} =
\int_\Gamma \eta\,\varkappa\,\nu_i\dH{d-1}\,,
\quad 1 \leq i \leq d\,.
\end{equation*}
Applying it with $\eta=h\,\underline{D}_i\,g$,
summing for all $i$ and taking into
account that $\nabs\,g\,.\,\vec \nu=0$ we obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}

\section{Properties of geometric flows}\label{sec:geometric_flows_properties}
Here we report some fundamental properties of the mean curvature flow and
surface diffusion. In order to derive these properties, we need a transport
theorem for integrals. Consider a family $\{ \Gamma(t) \}_{t \in [0, T]}$
of hypersurfaces that evolve over time. Such a family is called a
$C^{2,1}$-family of hypersurfaces if, for each point $(\vec z_0, t_0) \in
\R^d \times (0, T)$ with $\vec z_0 \in \Gamma_0$, there exists an
open set $G \subset \R^d$, $\delta > 0$ and a function
$g \in C^{2,1}(G \times (t_0 - \delta, t_0 + \delta))$ such that
\begin{equation}
G \cap \Gamma (t) = \{ \vec z \in G \, | \, g (\vec z, t) = 0 \}
\quad \mbox{ and } \quad \nabla \, g (\vec z, t) \neq 0
\quad \forall\ \vec z \in G \cap \Gamma(t) \, .
\end{equation}
\sloppy Moreover, suppose that each $\Gamma(t)$ is oriented by a unit normal
field ${\vec \nu(\cdot,t)\in C^1(\Gamma(t),\R^d)}$ and that $\vec \nu\in
C^0(\cup_{0<t<T}\Gamma(t)\times\{t\},\R^d)$.

We define the velocity at a point $(\vec z_0,t_0)$, with $\vec z_0\in
\Gamma(t_0)$, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Vphi}
\V(\vec z_0,t_0)= \vec \phi_t(t_0)\,, \quad
\mbox{with }\vec \phi(t_0)=\vec z_0\,,
\end{equation}
where $\vec \phi\in C^1((t_0 - \delta, t_0 + \delta),\R^d)$ and
$\vec \phi(t)\in\Gamma(t)$ for $|t-t_0|<\delta$. It can be shown that $\V(\vec
z_0,t_0)$ is independent of the particular choice of $\vec \phi$.

Now take a family $\{ \Gamma(t) \}_{t \in [0, T]}$ of evolving hypersurfaces
which satisfies the above assumptions and, moreover, suppose that each surface
$\Gamma(t)$ is compact. We are interested in the time derivative of certain
volume and area integrals. As usual, $\surfvol$ is the $(d-1)$-dimensional
Hausdorff measure and $\vol$ is the Lebesgue measure in $\R^d$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $g \in C^1(Q)$, where $Q$ is an open set containing

\begin{equation}
\bigcup_{0 < t < T} \Gamma(t) \times \{ t \} \, .
\end{equation}

Suppose in addition that each surface $\Gamma(t)$ is the boundary of an open
bounded subset $\Omega(t) \subset \R^d$. Then

\begin{align}
\ddt \int_{\Omega(t)} g \, \dL{d}  = &
\int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} \, \dL{d}
+ \int_{\Gamma(t)} g \,\V\,.\,\vec\nu \, \dH{d-1} \, ,
\label{eq:volume_variation} \\
\ddt \int_{\Gamma(t)} g \, \dH{d-1}  = &
\int_{\Gamma(t)} \frac{\partial g}{\partial t} \, \dH{d-1} -
\int_{\Gamma(t)} g \, \V\,.\,\vec\nu \varkappa \, \dH{d-1}
\nonumber \\
& \qquad + \int_{\Gamma(t)} \frac{\partial g}{\partial \vec \nu}\,
\V\,.\,\vec\nu \, \dH{d-1} \, .\label{eq:length_variation}
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For a proof, see \cite[\S2.6, Lemma 2.1]{DeckelnickDE05}.
\end{proof}

The evolution of an hypersurface subject to the mean curvature flow
(\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) exhibits the interesting area-decreasing property,
which is obtained from the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\Gamma(t)$ be a family of evolving hypersurfaces satisfying
(\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) and assume that each $\Gamma(t)$ is
compact. Then

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Gamma(t)} \varkappa^2 \, \dH{d-1} +
\ddt \surfvol(\Gamma(t)) = 0 \, . \label{eq:length_decrease}
\end{equation}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Choosing $g \equiv 1$ in (\ref{eq:length_variation}) and the evolution law
(\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) yields
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Gamma(t)} (\V\,.\,\vec\nu)^2 \,\dH{d-1} +\ddt \surfvol(\Gamma(t)) = 0\,,
\end{equation*}
and hence the desired result follows immediately from (\ref{eq:mean_curvature}).
\end{proof}
The case $d = 2$ is usually referred to as curve shortening flow.

On the other hand, the evolution of an hypersurface subject to surface
diffusion (\ref{eq:surface_diff}) conserves, for closed hypersurfaces, the
enclosed volume and decreases the area as obtained from the following
lemma

\begin{lemma}
Let $\Gamma(t)$ be a family of evolving hypersurfaces satisfying
(\ref{eq:surface_diff}) and assume that each $\Gamma(t)$ is
compact and closed. Then
\begin{align}
\ddt \vol(\Omega(t)) & = 0 \,, \label{eq:volume_conservation} \\
\int_{\Gamma(t)} |\nabs \, \varkappa|^2 \, \dH{d-1} + \ddt \surfvol (\Gamma(t))
& = 0 \,.\label{eq:area_decrease}
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For (\ref{eq:volume_conservation}), choosing $g \equiv 1$ in
(\ref{eq:volume_variation}) and the evolution law (\ref{eq:surface_diff}) yields
that
\begin{align*}
\ddt \vol(\Omega(t)) & = - \int_{\Gamma(t)} \V\,.\,\vec\nu \,
\dH{d-1} = \int_{\Gamma(t)} \Delta_s \, \varkappa \, \dH{d-1} \nonumber \\
& = -\int_{\Gamma(t)} \nabla_s \, \varkappa \,.\, \nabla_s \, 1 \, \dH{d-1}=0\,,
\end{align*}
where the third equality is obtained with the integration by part formula
(\ref{eq:integration_by_part}).

Similarly for (\ref{eq:area_decrease}), choosing $g \equiv 1$ in
(\ref{eq:length_variation}) and the evolution law (\ref{eq:surface_diff}) yields
to
\begin{equation*}
\ddt \surfvol(\Gamma(t)) = - \int_{\Gamma(t)} \V\,.\,\vec\nu
\varkappa \, \dH{d-1} = - \int_{\Gamma(t)} |\nabs \, \varkappa|^2 \, \dH{d-1}\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

From a physical point of view, equation (\ref{eq:length_decrease}) and
(\ref{eq:area_decrease}) are associated to the minimization of the surface
energy with constant energy density 1 which is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:surface_energy}
E(\Gamma(t)) = \int_{\Gamma(t)} 1 \, \dH{d-1} \, .
\end{equation}
We will see that surface diffusion is not dissimilar to two-phase Stokes flow,
in that in the absence of external forces the surface energy
(\ref{eq:surface_energy}) is decreased and the enclosed volume is conserved.

\section{Front tracking approach}\label{sec:front_tracking_approach}
We always treat the interface using a front tracking approach, which involves
seeking a parametrization of the unknown interface over a reference manifold.
More formally, we assume that $(\Gamma(t))_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a sufficiently
smooth evolving hypersurface without boundary which is parametrized by
$\vec x(\cdot,t):\Upsilon\to\R^d$, where $\Upsilon\subset \R^d$ is a given
reference manifold of the same topological type of the evolving hypersurface
$\Gamma(t)$, therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:interface_parametrization}
\Gamma(t) = \vec x(\Upsilon,t)\,.
\end{equation}
The position vector $\vec x(\cdot,t)$, for every time $t$, maps a certain point
$\vec q$ of the reference manifold $\Upsilon$ to its actual position
$\vec z$ on $\Gamma(t)$. Therefore, using (\ref{eq:interface_parametrization}),
we can define the surface velocity (\ref{eq:Vphi}) alternatively as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:V}
\V(\vec z, t) := \vec x_t(\vec q, t) \quad
\forall\ \vec z = \vec x(\vec q,t) \in \Gamma(t)\,.
\end{equation}

The position vector $\vec x(\cdot,t)$ is one unknown of the problem and, once
computed, the evolution of $\Gamma(t)$ is fully determined. Moreover, all the
geometrical quantities of the hypersurface, e.g. curvature, can be expressed as
derivatives of the parametrization.

It is worth to notice that, at the discrete level, the reference manifold
$\Upsilon$ is never used. Indeed, instead of computing the position vector
$\vec x(\cdot,t)$, the unknown variable is the displacement that the previous
discrete interface is subject to. This can be viewed as setting, at every time
step, a new reference manifold which correspond to the actual hypersurface
configuration.

\section{Finite element approximation}\label{sec:geometric_pdes_fem}
The finite element discretization which we use is based on the seminal paper
\cite{Dziuk91} and we refer to the ones described in
\cite{triplejMC,triplej,gflows3d}. We use a different notation in order to be
consistent with \cite{spurious} and \cite{stokesfitted}.

Putting together the mean curvature flow (\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) with the
identity (\ref{eq:LBop}) we obtain the following system of PDEs
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu &=\varkappa \quad &&\mbox{on } \Gamma(t)\,,
\label{eq:mean_curvature_a} \\
\varkappa\,\vec \nu &=\Delta_s\,\vec\id \quad &&\mbox{on } \Gamma(t)\,.
\label{eq:mean_curvature_b}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

Analogously, the surface diffusion problem (\ref{eq:surface_diff}) can be
rewritten as a system of second order equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu &=-\Delta_s\,\varkappa \quad &&\mbox{on }\Gamma(t)\,,
\label{eq:surf_diff_a} \\
\varkappa\,\vec \nu&=\Delta_s\,\vec\id \quad &&\mbox{on }\Gamma(t)\,.
\label{eq:surf_diff_b}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
In both problems (\ref{eq:mean_curvature_a}--b) and (\ref{eq:surf_diff_a}--b)
we impose the initial condition $\Gamma(0)=\Gamma_0$.

We consider the partitioning  $0= t_0 < t_1 < \ldots < t_{M-1} < t_M = T$ of
$[0,T]$ into possibly variable time steps
$\tau_m := t_{m+1}-t_m$, $m=0,\ldots, M-1$.

In order to define the parametric finite element spaces on $\Gamma^m$, we
assume that $\Gamma^m=\bigcup_{j=1}^{J_\Gamma} \overline{\sigma^m_j}$, where
$\{\sigma^m_j\}_{j=1}^{J_\Gamma}$ is a family of mutually disjoint open
$(d-1)$-simplices with vertices $\{\vec q^m_k\}_{k=1}^{K_\Gamma}$. We also
define the function space
\begin{equation}
\Vh := \{\vec\chi \in [C(\Gamma^m)]^d:\vec\chi\!\mid_{\sigma^m_j}
\in \mathcal{P}_1(\sigma^m_j), j=1,\ldots, J_\Gamma\} =: [\Wh]^d\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Wh \subset H^1(\Gamma^m)$ is the space of scalar continuous
piecewise linear functions on $\Gamma^m$, with $\{\chi^m_k\}_{k=1}^{K_\Gamma}$
denoting the standard basis of $\Wh$ and with $\mathcal{P}_k(\sigma^m)$
denoting the space of polynomials of degree $k$ on $\sigma^m$.

The new surface $\Gamma^{m+1}$ is parametrized with respect to $\Gamma^m$ using
the parametrization $\vec X^{m+1} \in \Vh$, so that $\Gamma^{m+1} =
\vec X^{m+1}(\Gamma^m)$.

Then the finite element approximation from \cite{triplejMC,gflows3d} of the
mean curvature flow, which is based on the variational formulation
(\ref{eq:mean_curvature_a}--b), is given as follows. Let $\Gamma^0$ be an
approximation to $\Gamma(0)$. For $m=0,\ldots,M-1$, find $(\vec X^{m+1},
\kappa^{m+1}) \in \Vh \times \Wh$ such that
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\left\langle \frac{\vec X^{m + 1} - \vec X^m}{\tau_m},
\chi\vec \nu^m\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h - \left\langle\kappa^{m+1}, \chi
\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h =& 0\quad \forall\ \chi \in
\Wh\,,\label{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}\\
\left\langle\kappa^{m+1}\vec \nu^m, \vec \eta\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h +
\left\langle\nabla_s\vec X^{m + 1},
\nabla_s\vec \eta\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m} =& 0\quad \forall\ \vec\eta \in \Vh,
\label{eq:fem_mean_curvature_b}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
and set $\Gamma^{m+1} = \vec X^{m+1}(\Gamma^m)$. We observe that
(\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) is a linear scheme in that it leads to a
linear system of equations for the unknowns $(\vec X^{m+1}, \kappa^{m+1})$ at
each time level. Here $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\Gamma^m}$ is the $L^2$ inner
product over the current polyhedral surface
\begin{equation}
\langle u,v\rangle_{\Gamma^m} = \int_{\Gamma^m}uv\,\dH{d-1}\,,
\quad \forall u,v \in L^2(\Gamma^m),
\end{equation}
and similarly for $\vec u,\vec v\in [L^2(\Gamma^m)]^d$. In addition,
$\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h$ is a mass lumped inner product with
the vertices of each triangle of the mesh as quadrature points. If $v,w \in
L^\infty(\Gamma^m)$ are piecewise continuous, with possible jumps
across the edges of $\{\sigma_j^m\}_{j=1}^{J_\Gamma}$, we define the mass
lumped inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h$ as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:masslump}
\left\langle v, w \right\rangle^h_{\Gamma^m} :=
\tfrac1d \sum_{j=1}^{J_\Gamma} \surfvol(\sigma^m_j)\,
\sum_{k=1}^d (v\,w)((\vec q^m_{j_k})^-),
\end{equation}
where $\{\vec q^m_{j_k}\}_{k=1}^d$ are the vertices of $\sigma^m_j$, and
where we define the limit $v((\vec q^m_{j_k})^-)
:= \underset{\sigma^m_j\ni \vec p\to \vec q^m_{j_k}}{\lim}\, v(\vec p)$. We
naturally extend (\ref{eq:masslump}) to vector valued functions. The mass
lumped inner product is used in (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_b}) to obtain good
mesh properties, see \S\ref{sec:geometric_pdes_semi_fem} below.
For stability it is
then necessary to use mass lumping on the first term in
(\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}), which makes it the natural
choice also for the second term. In fact, choosing $\chi=\kappa^{m+1}$ in
(\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}) and $\vec \eta=\vec X^{m+1} -
\vec\id\!\mid_{\Gamma^m}$ in (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_b}), and summing the
two equations, yields that
\begin{equation*}
\left\langle \nabs\,\vec X^{m+1}, \nabs\,(\vec X^{m+1} - \vec X^m)
\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m} +
\tau_m\langle \kappa^{m+1},\kappa^{m+1}\rangle^h_{\Gamma^m}=0\,.
\end{equation*}
Using the inequality
\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta_length_inequality}
\left\langle \nabs\,\vec X^{m+1}, \nabs\,(\vec X^{m+1} - \vec X^m)
\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m} \geq \surfvol(\Gamma^{m+1}) - \surfvol(\Gamma^m)\,,
\end{equation}
see e.g.\ \cite[Proof of Theorem~2.3]{triplej} and
\cite[Proof of Theorem~2.2]{gflows3d} for the proofs for $d=2$ and $d=3$,
respectively, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\surfvol(\Gamma^{m+1}) +
\tau_m \langle \kappa^{m+1},\kappa^{m+1}\rangle^h_{\Gamma^m}
\leq \surfvol(\Gamma^m)\,,
\end{equation*}
and, summing for $m=0,\ldots,k-1$, we finally obtain
\begin{equation*}
\surfvol(\Gamma^k)+\sum_{m=0}^{k-1} \tau_m
\langle \kappa^{m+1},\kappa^{m+1}\rangle^h_{\Gamma^m}
\leq \surfvol(\Gamma^0)\,,
\end{equation*}
for ${k=1,\ldots,M}$. Hence the scheme (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) is
unconditionally stable.

Similarly, the finite element approximation for the surface diffusion problem
(\ref{eq:surf_diff_a}--b) is analogous to the one obtained for the mean
curvature flow with the linear system (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b)
changed to
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\left\langle \frac{\vec X^{m + 1} - \vec X^m}{\tau_m},
\chi\vec \nu^m\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h - \left\langle\nabla_s\kappa^{m+1},
\nabla_s\chi\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m} =& 0\quad \forall\ \chi \in
\Wh\,,\label{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}\\
\left\langle\kappa^{m+1}\vec \nu^m, \vec \eta\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h +
\left\langle\nabla_s\vec X^{m + 1},
\nabla_s\vec \eta\right\rangle_{\Gamma^m} =& 0\quad \forall\ \vec\eta \in\Vh\,.
\label{eq:fem_surf_diff_b}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

If $\Gamma^m$ is an hypersurface without self-intersections, then there exists
a unique solution $(\vec X^{m+1}, \kappa^{m+1}) \in \Vh \times \Wh$ to the
systems (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) and (\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b).
See \cite[Theorem~2.1]{gflows3d} for the complete proof. Moreover, similarly to
before, choosing $\chi=\kappa^{m+1}$ in (\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}) and
$\vec \eta=\vec X^{m+1} - \vec\id\!\mid_{\Gamma^m}$ in
(\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_b}), yields that
\begin{equation*}
\surfvol(\Gamma^k)+\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\tau_m
\langle \nabs\,\kappa^{m+1},\nabs\,\kappa^{m+1}\rangle_{\Gamma^m}
\leq \surfvol(\Gamma^0)\,,
\end{equation*}
for ${k=1,\ldots,M}$. Hence also the scheme (\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b) is
unconditionally stable.

\section{Semidiscrete scheme}\label{sec:geometric_pdes_semi_fem}
As shown in \cite[Remark~2.3]{triplej} and \cite[\S4]{gflows3d}, it is
worthwhile to consider continuous-in-time semidiscrete versions of the
aforementioned finite element schemes.

Firstly, let $(\Gamma^h(t))_{t\in[0,T]}$ be a family of polyhedral surfaces,
with outer normal $\vec\nu^h(t)$. We also define the piecewise linear finite
element spaces $\Wht$ and $\Vht$, with $\{\chi^h_k(\cdot,t)\}_{k=1}^{K_\Gamma}$
denoting the standard basis of the former. Hence $\chi^h_k(\vec q^h_l(t),t) =
\delta_{kl}$ for all $k,l \in \{1,\ldots,K_\Gamma\}$ and $t \in [0,T]$, where
$\{\vec q^h_k(t)\}_{k=1}^{K_\Gamma}$ are the vertices of $\Gamma^h(t)$.
Similarly to (\ref{eq:V}), we can then define the discrete velocity
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Vsemidisc}
\V^h(\vec z, t):=
\sum_{k=1}^{K_\Gamma}\left[\ddt\,\vec q^h_k(t)\right] \chi^h_k(\vec z, t)
\in \Vht\,,
\end{equation}
see e.g. \cite[(3.3)]{tpfs}.

Then, the finite element approximation of the surface diffusion problem
(\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b) can be replaced by the following one. Given
$\Gamma^h(0)$, for $t\in (0,T]$ find $\Gamma^h(t)$ and $\kappa^h \in \Wht$ such
that
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\langle \vec{\mathcal{V}}^h, \chi \, \vec \nu^h \rangle_{\Gamma^h(t)}^h -
\langle \nabla_s \, \kappa^h , \nabla_s \, \chi \rangle_{\Gamma^h(t)} =& 0
\quad \forall\ \chi \in \Wht\,, \label{eq:semidisa} \\
\langle \kappa^h \,\vec \nu^h, \vec \eta \rangle^h_{\Gamma^h(t)} +
\langle \nabla_s \, \vec \id,\nabla_s \, \vec \eta \rangle_{\Gamma^h(t)} =& 0
\quad \forall\ \vec \eta \in \Vht\,, \label{eq:semidisb}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we always integrate over the current surface $\Gamma^h(t)$, with normal
$\vec \nu^h(t)$. In
addition, $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle^{(h)}_{\Gamma^h(t)}$ is the
continuous-in-time counterpart of $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^{(h)}$
where $\Gamma^m$ is replaced by $\Gamma^h(t)$.

Firstly, choosing $\chi \equiv 1$ in (\ref{eq:semidisa}) and recalling the mass
lumped inner product (\ref{eq:masslump}), we have that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vol}
0 = \langle \vec{\mathcal{V}}^h, \vec \nu^h \rangle^h_{\Gamma^h(t)}
= \int_{\Gamma^h(t)} \vec{\mathcal{V}}^h\, \cdot \, \vec \nu^h \dH{d-1}
= \ddt \, \vol(\Omega^h(t)) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega^h(t) \subset \R^d$ is open bounded set whose boundary is
given by $\Gamma^h(t)$. Therefore, the continuous-in-time semidiscrete version
of the aforementioned surface diffusion finite element scheme conserves the
enclosed volume exactly. It does not appear possible to prove the conservation
of the enclosed volume for the fully discrete scheme but, from all the
numerical simulations performed in this thesis, we experimentally observe that
the enclosed volume is approximately preserved, and that the volume loss tends
to zero as $\tau \to 0$.

We now investigate an equidistribution property for the scheme
(\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b), see \cite[Remark~2.4]{triplej} and
\cite[Theorem~3.2]{NurnbergS14} for more details.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:equidistribution_property}
Let $d = 2$ and let $\{ \vec q_k^h \}_{k = 1}^{K_{\Gamma}^h}$ denote the
sequentially ordered vertices on $\Gamma^h(t)$. Let
$( \Gamma^h(t), \kappa^h(t) )$
be a solution to the system (\ref{eq:semidisa}--b), and set
$\vec h_k(t) := \vec q^h_k(t) - \vec q^h_{k - 1}(t)$.
Then it holds that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equidistribSemidis}
|\vec h_k(t)| = |\vec h_{k - 1}(t)| \quad \mbox{if} \quad
\vec h_k(t) \nparallel \vec h _{k - 1}(t) \quad k = 1, \ldots, K_{\Gamma}^h \, .
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Choosing $\vec \eta = (\vec h_{k + 1} + \vec h_k) \, \phi_k \in \Vht$ in
(\ref{eq:semidisb}), where $\{ \phi_l \}_{l = 1}^{K_{\Gamma}^h}$ denote the
basis functions of $\Wht$, and recalling \ref{eq:masslump}, we obtain that for
$k = 1,\ldots,K_{\Gamma}^h$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intermEquidis_first}
0 = \langle \nabla_s \, \vec \id, \nabla_s \, [ (\vec h_{k + 1} + \vec h_k)
\, \phi_k ] \rangle_{\Gamma^h(t)}\, .
\end{equation}

The integral in (\ref{eq:intermEquidis_first}) can now be easily computed by
hand, since the support of $\phi_k$ is given by $[\vec q_{k - 1}, \, \vec q_k]
\cup [\vec q_k, \, \vec q_{k + 1}]$. On noting that
$\nabla_s \, \phi_k = \frac{1}{|\vec h_k|}$ on $[\vec q_{k - 1}, \, \vec q_k]$
and $\nabla_s \, \phi_k = - \, \frac{1}{|\vec h_{k + 1}|}$ on $[\vec q_k, \,
\vec q_{k + 1}]$, we then deduce that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intermEquidis}
\Big [ \frac{\vec h_{k + 1}}{|\vec h_{k + 1}|} -\frac{\vec h_k}{|\vec h_k|}
\ \Big ] \cdot \, (\vec h_{k + 1} + \vec h_k) = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
It immediately follows from (\ref{eq:intermEquidis}) that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TM}
(|\vec h_{k + 1}| - |\vec h_k|) (|\vec h_{k + 1}| \, |\vec h_k|
- \, \vec h_{k + 1} \, \cdot \, \vec h_k) = 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
which means that the desired result (\ref{eq:equidistribSemidis}) follows
directly from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
\end{proof}
Therefore, in the $d=2$ case, the continuous-in-time semidiscrete version of
(\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b) will always equidistribute the vertices provided
that they are not locally parallel. Only a fully implicit scheme can achieve
that also on the fully discrete level, see \cite{fdfi}, but a fully implicit
scheme is very expensive without providing better accuracy for the solution.
Nevertheless, in practice we see that for the semi-implicit schemes
(\ref{eq:mean_curvature_a}--b) and (\ref{eq:surf_diff_a}--b) over a number of
time steps, the vertices are moved tangentially so that they will eventually be
equidistributed.

Instead in \cite[\S4]{gflows3d} the case $d=3$ has been thoroughly investigated
showing that the continuous-in-time semidiscrete versions of
(\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) and (\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b) guarantee
good mesh properties. Again, in practice, we notice that it is true for the
fully discrete schemes.

We want to stress the fact that this equidistribution property is only
achievable because (\ref{eq:mean_curvature}) and (\ref{eq:surface_diff})
prescribe the velocity only in the normal direction while, in the tangential
direction, the mesh vertices are free to move. Moreover, if instead of the mass
lumped inner product (\ref{eq:masslump}) it is used an exact quadrature, an
analogue of the equidistribution properties cannot be established.

\section{Algebraic formulation}\label{sec:geometric_pdes_algebraic}
As regards the mean curvature flow, (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b), the
corresponding algebraic system of equations can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:algebraic_mean_curvature}
\begin{pmatrix}
M_\Gamma & -\,\frac{1}{\tau_m} \, \vec N_\Gamma^T \\
\vec N_\Gamma & \vec A_\Gamma
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\kappa^{m + 1} \\
\delta \vec X^{m + 1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
- \vec A_\Gamma \, \vec X^m
\end{pmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
while, for the system of equations describing the surface diffusion,
(\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b), the algebraic system is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:algebraic_surf_diff}
\begin{pmatrix}
A_\Gamma & - \,\frac{1}{\tau_m}\, \vec N_\Gamma^T \\
\vec N_\Gamma & \vec A_\Gamma
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\kappa^{m + 1} \\
\delta \vec X^{m + 1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
- \vec A_\Gamma \, \vec X^m
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where we define the interface displacement $\delta \vec X^{m + 1}=\vec X^{m +
1} - \vec X^m$ and we have used the trivial identity $\vec A_\Gamma\,\vec
X^{m+1} = \vec A_\Gamma\,\vec X^m + \vec A_\Gamma\,\delta \vec X^{m+1}$. We can
notice that the only difference between the above systems occurs in the
upper-left entry of the matrix.

The entries of the matrix are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[ M_\Gamma \right]_{kl} & := & \langle \chi_k^m \, , \chi_l^m
\rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h\,,\label{eq:algebraic_entries_a} \\
\left[ \vec N_\Gamma \right]_{kl} & := & \langle \chi_k^m \, \vec \nu^m\,,
\chi_l^m \rangle_{\Gamma^m}^h\,,\label{eq:algebraic_entries_b} \\
\left[ A_\Gamma \right]_{kl} & := & \langle \nabla_s \chi_k^m \, , \nabla_s
\chi_l^m \rangle_{\Gamma^m}\,,\label{eq:algebraic_entries_c}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\{\chi_k^m\}$ are the basis functions of the finite element space of
piecewise linear continuous functions $W(\Gamma^m)$ and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:algebraic_entries_d}
[\vec A_\Gamma]_{kl} := [A_\Gamma]_{kl} \mat \id\,.
\end{equation}
Since the entries of $A_\Gamma$ can be assembled by summing up the contributions
to (\ref{eq:algebraic_entries_c}) over all the elements, and since each
contribution is a planar integral in $\R^d$ with the integrand being a
constant, we notice that (\ref{eq:algebraic_entries_c}) can be assembled in a
straightforward way.

The linear systems (\ref{eq:algebraic_mean_curvature}) and
(\ref{eq:algebraic_surf_diff}) are invertible under a suitable assumption on the
triangulation at each time step, see \cite{gflows3d}. The algebraic system
(\ref{eq:algebraic_mean_curvature}) and (\ref{eq:algebraic_surf_diff}) are
very small also for fine meshes. Therefore they can be solved very efficiently
with a sparse factorization package such as \verb|UMFPACK|, see \cite{Davis04}.

\section{Numerical results}\label{sec:geometric_pdes_results}
Here we report on several numerical examples to benchmark the schemes
(\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) and (\ref{eq:fem_surf_diff_a}--b).

With a view towards our numerical simulations, we want to be able to compute
the initial mean curvature $\kappa^0$ of an initial surface $\Gamma^0$ in
order to plot it. This initial mean curvature $\kappa^0$ can be computed by
solving the algebraic system
\begin{equation}\label{eq:algebraic_initial_curvature}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\vec N_\Gamma^{T} \\
\vec N_\Gamma & \vec A_\Gamma
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\kappa^0 \\
\delta \vec X^0
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
- \vec A_\Gamma \, \vec X^0
\end{pmatrix}
\,,
\end{equation}
which is a discretization of the stationary geometric PDE
\begin{equation}
\V\,.\,\vec\nu=0\quad\mbox{on }\Gamma(t)\,,
\end{equation}
in the flavour of (\ref{eq:fem_mean_curvature_a}--b) for the mean curvature
flow (\ref{eq:mean_curvature}).

\subsection{Mean curvature flow with a sphere as initial condition}
\label{subsec:mc_sphere}
As regards the mean curvature flow, the simplest case is to use a sphere as the
initial condition, see \cite{Ilmanen98}. In this case, the solution to the
geometric evolution equation is known in closed form and it is a shrinking
sphere. Let $\Gamma(t) = \{ \vec z \in \R^d : |\vec z -\vec z_0| = r(t) \}$ be
a sphere centered in $\vec z_0$ with radius $r(t)$ and mean curvature
$\varkappa(t) = -\frac{d-1}{r(t)}$. Its unit outer normal is given by
$\vec \nu(\vec z) = \frac{\vec z - \vec z_0}{r(t)}$. It is straightforward to
derive that $\V\,.\,\vec\nu = r^\prime(t)$ on $\Gamma(t)$, so that
$\Gamma(t)$ moves by mean curvature provided that $r^\prime(t) = - \frac{d -
1}{r(t)}$. The solution of this separable variable ODE is easily given by
\begin{equation}
r(t) = \sqrt{r_0^2 - 2(d - 1)t}\,, \quad t\in [0,t_e)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(0) = \{ \vec z \in \R^d : |\vec z -\vec z_0| = r_0 \}$ and
\begin{equation}
t_e=\frac{r_0^2}{2(d - 1)}
\end{equation}
is the so called extinction time. It is worth noting that the surface
$\Gamma(t)$ shrinks to a point as $t \to t_e$.

Figure~\ref{fig:mcf_sphere} shows the evolution of a sphere with initial radius
$r_0=5$ at time $t=0$, $t=2$, $t=4$ and $t=6$ respectively. In this case, the
extinction time, is $t_e=6.25$. The number of mesh elements is $J_\Gamma=3026$
and the time step is constant and equal to $\tau=10^{-3}$.

over time of the discrete spheres $\Gamma^m$, while the blue plot is the exact
radius computed from the analytical solution.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Equidistribution property}\label{subsec:sd_circle}
In order to show the equidistribution property of the scheme, we simulate the
evolution, under surface diffusion, of a circle of radius $r_0=0.5$ with a very
poor initial mesh quality. Indeed, the initial curve consists of a semi-circle
and a single additional node on the periphery of the circle for a total number
of mesh elements equal to $J_\Gamma=32$.

Figure~\ref{fig:sd_circle} shows the mesh evolution at time $t=0$, $t=0.05$,
$t=0.25$ and $t=10$ respectively with a constant time step equal to
$\tau=10^{-2}$. One can clearly see that although the true solution, which is a
circle, is reached very quickly, in the remaining time the vertices are
continually moved tangentially, which results in a further decrease in the ratio
\begin{equation}
\frac{\max_{\sigma\in \Gamma^m}\surfvol(\sigma)}
{\min_{\sigma\in\Gamma^m}\surfvol(\sigma)}\,,
\end{equation}
which approaches the optimal value 1. This mesh quality indicator is simply the
ratio between the maximum and minimum segment of the hypersurface.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\subfloat[$t=0$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]

circle of initial radius $r_0=0.5$ subject to surface diffusion.}
\label{fig:sd_circle}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:sd_circle_tau} we see that the equidistribution velocity is
varying inversely with the size of $\tau$. For example, when $\tau=10^{-4}$,
the equidistribution is reached almost instantaneously.

$\tau=10^{-3}$ and in blue $\tau=10^{-4}$.}
\label{fig:sd_circle_tau}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Surface diffusion with a cage as initial condition}
\label{subsec:sd_cage}
Our last simulation is inspired by the test in \cite[Fig.~15]{gflows3d}. We
investigate the evolution of a cage subject to surface diffusion. The
dimensions of the initial surface are $4 \times 4 \times 4$, with the region
enclosed by $\Gamma(0)$ given as the union of 12 cuboids of dimension $4 \times
1 \times 1$.

Figure~\ref{fig:sd_cage} shows the cage evolution at time $t=0$, $t=0.2$,
$t=0.4$ and $t=0.6$ respectively. The number of mesh elements is
$J_\Gamma=3816$ and the time step is constant and equal to $\tau=10^{-2}$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\subfloat[$t=0$]{\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]

\caption[Surface diffusion cage]{Surface evolution of a cage $4 \times 4 \times
4$ subject to surface diffusion.}
\label{fig:sd_cage}
\end{figure}

At time $t=0.6$ a topological change is encountered when the six holes of the
surface are about to close to form a hollow ball.
Figure~\ref{fig:sd_cage_section} shows a section of this hallow ball. This
hallow ball is still topological equivalent with the cage, i.e. genus is 5.
Indeed we can see 6 very long and thin strands of elements, which connect the
inner ball with the outer ball.  A topological change breaks the front tracking
approach since the reference manifold $\Gamma^m$ is not topological compatible
with the unknown surface $\Gamma^{m+1}$. In practice, it is possible to apply
some heuristic algorithms for the detection of topological changes, such as the
merging of surfaces into one or the pinching-off of one surface from another,
which can lead to a modified surface mesh that can be handled again with the
parametric approach, see \cite{Sacconi}.

\end{figure}

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:sd_cage_energy} shows the evolution of the surface
energy (\ref{eq:surface_energy}) over time. As expected, see
(\ref{eq:area_decrease}), this energy is monotonically decreasing.
